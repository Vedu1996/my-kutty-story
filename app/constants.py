Her nimble fingers, more accustomed to mending broken looms than stitching lace, yearned for the intricate gears of clockwork and the hum of nascent machinery. Despite the era's confines for women, Elara dreamt of inventing, not merely operating. Her current challenge was a temperamental steam valve on the mill's newest engine, a device baffling even the seasoned engineers.
